A "Hello World" program is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". Normally it is the first program written by people learning to code. It  is also  used as a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.

:::funfact
Veteran software developers know the "Hello World" program as the first step in learning to code. The program, which normall outputs some variant of “Hello, World!” on a device’s display, can be created in most languages, making it some of the most basic syntax involved in the coding process. In fact, a recent project at the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) at Louisiana Tech found opens in new windowthat there are at least 204 versions of the program.
