title: Introducing Hello World
description: Learn more about the Hello World tutorial and get started learning MLAPI.
---

A "Hello World" program is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". Normally it is the first program written by people learning to code. It  is also  used as a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it. 

While we are not going to output the message "Hello World" we will be taking you through some basic steps that will let you check that you have installed MLAPI correctly and that you understand the fundemantals of using MLAPI.

:::funfact
Veteran software developers know the "Hello World" program as the first step in learning to code. The program, which normaly outputs some variant of “Hello, World!” on a device’s display, can be created in most languages, making it some of the most basic syntax involved in the coding process. In fact, a recent project at the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) at Louisiana Tech found opens in new windowthat there are at least 204 versions of the program.
