title:  Learning with MLAPI Introduction
description: Introduction to the Hello world and Golden Path series, explaining the underliying aim of the series 
---

These sections are intended to help guide you through the features of MLAPI, they will provide  examples of how MLAPI implements common  Multiplayer features. We will continue to add and update this section with more materials as we grow MLAPI.  


Learning with MLAPI is split into two distinct areas:

- [Hello World:](helloworldintro.md) These guides to show you how to install MLAPI into Unity and check that everything is working correctly by guiding you through the creation of a basic multiplayer game.
- [GoldenPath:](goldenpath_series/goldenpath.md) These are intended as a series of guides that will help introduce MLAPI features both old and new. We have designed it to be modular so that you can jump directly to those sections that will be of interest to you.  New modules will be added over time.
