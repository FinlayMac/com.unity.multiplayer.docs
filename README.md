# Unity Multiplayer Docs

Welcome to the Unity Multiplayer Technology (MTT) Documentation. This site includes MLAPI, Multipie, and other tools and features supporting MTT.

The documentation site is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/). 

## Installation

The first time you clone the repo, run the following command to install. You only need to run this once.

```console
yarn install
```

## Building on Local

1. Run the build command to generate a site. This command generates static content into the `build` directory.

    ```console
    yarn build
    ```

2. Start a local development server and open up a browser window with the following command. Most changes are hot-loaded, displaying without requiring a rebuild and restart.

    ```console
    yarn start
    ```

## Contributing Content

See the Contribution Guide for details. A [template file](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.docs/blob/master/docs/template.md) (file located at /docs/template.md) is included in the repo to understand markdown formatting and options.
